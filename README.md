Hello!
Welcome to my first User Centric Front End Development project.
In this project I was asked to produce a webpage for a 1960's rock band 'The Monkees'.
I first started with the header, which is used on all 4 pages and acts as the main navigation for the web-site. I used bootstrap grid system to help with
the ease of navigation. I then moved on to the Footer which is also used on all 4 pages. In the footer I include social links and links to places where you can buy/listen
to the band's music (these are external links so I made sure they open in a new window so the user doesn't lose the page they are on). The footer also contains a link
the 'hire' page through the 'contact the band here' statement which can be used by potential employers or people in general who would like to contact/hire the band.
I have 4 pages on the website: The Homepage; which contains a brief description of the band and highlights the fact they are available for hire,
and a black and white picture of the band performing live which I thought got across the band's energy quite well while keeping the home page easy and simple to navigate.
The music page; which contains some tracks from the band's catalog along with a video of the band performing.
The About page; which includes a picture of each of the band members along with a description of what they do in the band.
The hire us page; this page includes a form (as required) for people to get in touch/ enquire about the band's availability and pricing. As this project is just CSS and HTML
the form doesn't go anywhere, however there are form requirements in place so if any required information is left out of the form, the user should be notified.
I have made the website as responsive as possible, so it should look appropriate in mobile/tablet and desktop devices. I achieved this by using media queries and appropriate CSS.
I have deployed the project numerous times throughout the building of it by running it in my browser and checking the responsiveness as I go by using the 'inspect'
tool in google chrome. I have tested the website in Firefox and internet explorer as well as opening it in different devices.
I did several git adds and git commits throughout the building of the project to ensure my work was safe. Finally I committed the final project to GitHub for all to see.
So I really hope you enjoy this website, I have enjoyed making it!
Melanie Milsted.
